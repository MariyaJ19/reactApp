# reactApp

The purpose of this application is to allow students to order food and collect at their convenience, this is beneficial during the Covid19 pandemic as it reduces interactions with other people therefore reducing risk. 
the application consists of registration and login system incorporating firebase alongside a menu page which shows food items for multiple food stores. 

Overall, this project provided the firsthand opportunity to build a web application and learn REACTJS, as well as an opportunity to expand my knowledge regarding web applications and understand in depth how they are built.
